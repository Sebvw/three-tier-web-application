Three tier web application terraform code

Improvements to be made if I had more time:
* Use variables throughout and use tfvars file to define variable values 
* Use modules (so that code isnâ€™t repeated) 
* Improve naming and tags for resources (follow a naming convention) 
* Store state file externally e.g. S3/DyanmoDB
* Improve code to allow to be easily deploy into multiple environments 
* Use HTTPS for connections + certificates 

Resources:
* VPC
* Subnets (Web, Application, Database)
* Security groups (Web, Application, Database)
* Internet and NAT Gateways
* Application Load Balancer
* Autoscaling group for web server EC2 instances 
* Multi-AZ RDS
